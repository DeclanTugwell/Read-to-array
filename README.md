# Read-to-array
Reads a text file and converts it directly into a 2 Dimensional array.
In order to format the file for this to work, each column within the text file must be marked using a ";" at the end.
An example of a suitably formatted text file is as follows...

Example format:
----------------------------------------
example1.1;example2.1;example3.1;
example1.2;example2.2;example3.2;
example1.3;example2.3;example3.3;
----------------------------------------

This table above would be ar 2D array that has 3 rows and 3 columns.

This is my first c# project and I made it in order to practise and learn more about c# as well as coding in general.
